# Book of Faces

Book of Faces is a social network web app based off of the widely used social network app, Facebook. Users can make a profile, send friend requests to other users, create posts, like and/or comment on other posts, and see a 'timeline' of all posts.

This is The Odin Project's [Final Ruby on Rails Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/final-project).

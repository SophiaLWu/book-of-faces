# Book of Faces

Book of Faces is a social network web app based off of the widely used social network app, Facebook. Users can make a profile, send friend requests to other users, create posts, like and/or comment on other posts, and see a 'timeline' of all posts.

This is The Odin Project's [Final Ruby on Rails Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/final-project).

## TODO
- Fix error messages
- Notification tab functionality
- Add pagination for friend requests
- User can't friend someone that already friend him/her (fix uniqueness of friendship model)
- Use polymorphic association to make post allow either text OR photo
- After editing comments/posts, redirect back to previous page rather than root
- Unit tests to make sure associations are set up and deleting users deletes
 everything associated with that user

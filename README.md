# Book of Faces

Book of Faces is a social network web app based off of the widely used social network app, Facebook. Users can make a profile, send friend requests to other users, create posts, like and/or comment on other posts, and see a 'timeline' of all posts.

This is The Odin Project's [Final Ruby on Rails Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/final-project).

### TODO
- Deploy app to Heroku with SendGrid add-on
- Users can't see other users' profiles unless they are friends
- Validations for being signed in to see certain pages
- User can't friend someone that already friend him/her (fix uniqueness of friendship model)
- Allow posts to have images
- Use Paperclip gem to allow users to upload a photo to their profile
- Use polymorphic association to make post allow either text OR photo
- Styling
